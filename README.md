# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client is The Gaming Room.  They wanted our firm to help them expand their gaming app onto multiple platforms specifically Linux, Mac, and Windows. The following software requirements be met for the game application: 1) A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved. 2) Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
3) Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name. 4) Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I provided an executive summary, summarizing what needs The Game Room desired for their app and listed the design constraints involved. I also evaluated the development requirements of the 3 platforms. I analyzed the characteristics of and techniques specific to various systems architectures and made a recommendation to The Gaming Room. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The executive summary and design constraints were a huge help, because I was essentially creating an algorithm that I could use as a guide to develop code for this project.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation part of the software design document. I would gain more knowledge of the development requirements and the platforms so that I would possibly list more and more efficient characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each of the platforms, which in turn give the client more knowledge of how we intend to expand their app.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I broke down all of the needs of the user one by one to carefully assess how I would implement such requirements and then I did further research and implement each requirement so that the user would be satified with the finished product. If we don't consider the user's needs then the user would probably not like our services and not want the product or to not use us again to provide their products.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software careful and methodically.  I had to make sure that everything required was accounted for and correct. I would try using interface, component, data structure, and algorithm designs, because they would be important in really making this project really stand out above all others.
